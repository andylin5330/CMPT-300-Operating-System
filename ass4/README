1. 
Explain how the system establishes the corresponding physical location. 
Answer: 
The computer has 2^32 bytes for a virtual-memory space.
The computer has 2^18 bytes for a physical memory.
The virtual memory is implemented bypaging, and the page size is 4096 (2^12) bytes.
We can find a page number with the first 20 bits of the virtual address,
and the page offset is the last 12 bits of the virtual address.
Establishing the corresponding physical location need to use the translation look-aside buffer hardware.

Hardware aspects:
The page number and offset are sparated in the logical address.
The page number is sent to the TLB.
If page number is sent to the TLB, the frame number is accessed from the TLB,
and the frame number and offset are added together to obtain the physical address.

Software aspects:
Only when the page number is not sent into the TLB, the frame number must be looked up in the page table in main memory.


2. 
What is the maximum acceptable page-fault rate for an effective access time of no more than 200
nanoseconds?
Answer: 
Average page fault time:
(8ms * (1-70%)) + (20ms * 70%) 
= 2.4ms + 14ms
= 16.4ms
= 1.64 * 10^7 nanoseconds

effective access time:
200ns = [(1-page-fault%) * 100ns] + [(page-fault rate) * (1.64 * 10^7ns)]
200ns = 100 - (100*page-fault rate) + (1.64*10^7 * page-fault rate)
100ns = (1.64*10^7 - 100) * page-fault rate
page-fault rate = 0.00000609759

Therefore, the maximum page-fault rate is 0.00061%.
